# Delivery completion gating

Driver-delivery orders must NOT be closed by the driver alone. The state machine is:
`arrived → delivered_pending_confirmation → delivered`, and the final `delivered`
transition happens ONLY when the customer confirms receipt.

- Driver sets `delivered_pending_confirmation` (never `delivered`).
- Customer confirm-receipt button (shown only for `delivered_pending_confirmation`)
  calls `markOrderDelivered`, which finalizes the order.
- Customer also has a reject-receipt action in that state that raises a delivery
  complaint and does NOT finalize the order.
- Provider "confirm delivered" is for SELF-PICKUP only (no `driverUid`). It must never
  appear for driver-delivery orders.

**Invariants enforced in `markOrderDelivered` (DataContext):** the actor must be the
order's customer (`authUser.uid === order.customerUid`); and if an order has a
`driverUid` its `deliveryStatus` must be `delivered_pending_confirmation`, else it
throws. Defense-in-depth so no UI path can bypass the gate.

**Why:** original flow let the driver / provider's confirm-delivered button jump
straight to `delivered`, closing the order before the customer acknowledged receipt.

# Customer writes must survive Firestore rules (rules-resilient write pattern)

Firestore rules let the customer change delivery-only fields (proven: a customer
update of `{deliveryMethod, deliveryStatus, deliveryQuoteId}` succeeds) but appear to
DENY a customer changing `status` / `paymentStatus`. A single `updateDoc` mixing
allowed + denied fields fails entirely → the user saw `orderUpdateError`.

**Rule:** for any customer-initiated order completion, split the write: a *primary*
write of only the field(s) the customer is permitted to change (`{deliveryStatus:
'delivered'}` — the UI keys "delivered" off `deliveryStatus`), then a *best-effort*
try/catch write of the richer fields (`status`, `customerConfirmedAt`, `completedAt`,
`updatedAt`, COD→`paymentStatus`) that swallows rule denials. Never let the richer
write block confirmation.

# Delivery complaints → `delivery_complaints` (NOT `complaints`)

The admin dashboard (Cloudflare Worker) reads the **`delivery_complaints`** collection.
An earlier bug wrote to `complaints` with fields `resolved`/`driverNote`, so complaints
never appeared in admin. Always write complaints to `delivery_complaints` with
admin-compatible fields: `orderId, orderNumber, orderRef, customerUid, providerUid,
driverUid, status, deliveryStatus, complaintStatus:'pending', source, type, note,
createdAt/updatedAt`.

`raiseDeliveryComplaint(order, {source,type,note})` builds this payload — driver call
defaults `source='driver'`; customer reject uses `source='customer'`,
`type='customer_rejected_receipt'`.

**Admin compatibility:** the Worker's `complaintEffStatus()` only recognizes
`open/resolved/closed` and falls back to `'open'` for anything else, so
`complaintStatus:'pending'` displays under the admin "Open" filter. Do not change the
Worker for this.

## Open items (not in repo)
- Firestore security rules are NOT in the repo (Firebase console). Live success of
  complaint creation requires a rule allowing authed `create` on `delivery_complaints`;
  the richer confirm-receipt fields require customer update perms. Rules were NOT
  touched by this work — report the exact rule to the user if live writes still deny.
